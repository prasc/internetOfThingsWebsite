        <h2>Applications of IoT</h2>
        <p>
          IOT application can be almost applied to any industry especially in
          this day and time.
        </p>
        <h3>Wearables:</h3>
        <p>
          This includes fit bits and smartwatches which monitor your physical
          activities such as steps, heart rate (5). These types of devices are
          considered to be small and energy efficient devices (6). In order to
          monitor, the devices consist of sensors to display these readings to
          the user (6).
        </p>
        <h3>Healthcare:</h3>
        <p>
          The healthcare industry is a huge industry consisting of doctors,
          nurses, patients etc. which all require important information to keep
          track of. A great example is monitoring their patients. In order to do
          this in an efficient manner, IOT improved patient care by allowing
          doctors to obtain real time data on the patient’s condition (6). IOT
          has also helped with the development of smart beds which also consists
          of sensors to monitor the patient’s vital signs (6).
        </p>
        <h3>Traffic Monitor</h3>
        <p>
          IOT in traffic monitor is very helpful to provide drivers real time
          data on traffic flow. This makes it very convenient for drivers to
          plan accordingly as the data would provide time of arrival, distance,
          accident information etc (6). This data is provided by mobile phones
          which consist of sensors to gather and share the information through
          applications such as Google maps or Waze (5). IOT is also helpful to
          provide information about “smart cities” to understand the global
          problems faced in different countries (5). Information such as clean
          water, air quality, population density etc. is provided in smart
          cities which helps in making future country plans (5).
