        <h2>Data Sharing, Security & Privacy</h2>
        <h3>The reason behind sharing data</h3>
        <p>
          Sharing data allows for IOT to bring more efficiency to our day-to-day
          lifestyle (2). It is a way for many sectors of our global economy to
          consider different way of providing good and services to our consumers
          (2). The idea behind sharing data amongst the connected devices is to
          provide efficiency to the users as well as our economy through the
          collection of this data (2).
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy & Security Issues</h3>
        <p>
          Putting data especially personal information onto the internet already
          poses a threat to be hacked at any time. This is something that a user
          is supposed to be aware of initial to posting. In the case of IOT,
          since all the devices are connected, there is a possibility for this
          data to be hacked, surveillances, monitored, location tracking etc.
          (2). For example, a user of a cellphone such as an iPhone usually has
          their smartwatch, laptop and other devices connected. However, if one
          of the devices was ever to be hacked, they would have access to all
          the data on all devices in edition to being tracked and monitored.
