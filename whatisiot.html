        <h2>What is IoT?</h2>
        <p>
          Internet of things (IOTâ€™s) explains the concept of integral network of
          devices to one another through the means of the Internet with a
          controlled mechanism to turn on and off (1). This allows a form of
          communication between these interconnected devices through the
          Internet which can help them to stay in sync to one another for
          example to complete a daily task such as making coffee in time (2).
        </p>
        <h2>Why is it useful for these devices to be connected?</h2>
        <p>
          The connection of these devices and allowing them to share data to one
          another facilitates user in collecting data, analysing the data, and
          producing an encounter or action contributing to learning and/or
          assisting in a task to be completed (2).
